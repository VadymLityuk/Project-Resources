we tally up the victims in all our favorite movies.it's time to wrap up with another franchise the actual final final destination part 5 which came out in 2011. Like a previous entry part 5 was filmed and realeased in 3d but unlike the previous entry part 5 is not a heaping pile of shit. To me part 5 is a huge step up over the previous two films mostly because of two things - characters and tone although this entry still has a handful of shit bags running around including the requisite creeper most everyone feels like a real believable person and the one who isn't the carrtoonish pervert is at played be a talanted character actor and properly portrayed as a sleazebag plus the leads are among the best in the franchise including Myles Fisher giving perhaps the greatest performance out of all these movies which shouldn't be a surprise because Miles Fisher's fucking dope if unfamiliar with this dude who looks like the love child of Tom Сruise and Christian Bale you should probably make yourself familiar pronto .
He also talented musician and in fact he made a music video for his song new romance featuring the cast of this movie and a gory Saved by the Bell parody it's a hilarious video and kick-ass song so you should probably check it out and 
when you're done there  go watch his other music video that parodies American Psycho for his cover of this must be the place by Talking Heads . 
Ok i'll stop gushing about him for now.The tone of this move it's also an improvement for the series since it manages to balance the dark suspense of the original film with some light-hearted humor while never veering too hard into the cynical snark so prevalent in part 4 this change in tone and quality may from the new talent behind the camera here instead of having a repeat writer or director all new dudes were brought in for part 5 namely director Stephen Quayle and writer Eric Hersler who very odd screenplay history includes the deadfulNightmare on Elm Street remake and the 2011 The Thing prequel wich you know i wasn't the biggest fan of but also the oscar nominated arrival and then the mediocre Bird Box it's hard for me to understand how the same guy wrote all of those very different movies but  hey he did give us arrivel and final destination  5 so keep doing  your thing dude . Finally  let's see how many death will close up this franchise with and get to theme
